                        The first two weeks of coaching will be focused on working on building what I like to
                        call a "champions mindset". This mindset is crucial when facing roadblocks and working to get to
                        your successes.

                        Weeks 3 and 4 of this program will be focused on finding your strengths and core competencies.
                        We will find jobs you do well and enjoy, and specifically target a few companies that would suit
                        you well.

                        The final two weeks of this program will be dedicated to your personal branding. What does this
                        mean? Your personal branding is all about you! During these two weeks, we will go over how to
                        crack
                        any interview, how to write a winning resume, and how to market yourself so that companies will
                        come
                        to you first.

                        When joining the six week program, it is natural to feel confused or stuck. After you finish,
                        I can personally guarantee you that you will leave feeling confident and ready to get your dream
                        job. The course is structured to break things down week by week, and work on constructing
                        yourself
                        so that by the end, you achieved your best self. Let's get started together.
